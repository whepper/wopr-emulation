A faithful Python implementation of the WOPR computer system from the iconic 1983 film **WarGames**. Relive the classic movie experience with authentic dialogue, the Joshua password backdoor, DEFCON escalation, a global command interface, tic-tac-toe in all three modes, and the famous conclusion that "the only winning move is not to play."

## 🎬 About the Movie

*WarGames* (1983) starring Matthew Broderick tells the story of a young hacker who accidentally accesses WOPR, a military supercomputer designed to simulate nuclear war scenarios. What begins as a game becomes a race against time to prevent actual World War III. The film's message about the futility of nuclear war remains powerful and relevant.

## 🎮 How to Play

### The Authentic WarGames Experience

Follow these steps to recreate the movie's iconic scenes:

#### 1. **System Logon**
```
LOGON: [Enter any name]
PASSWORD: joshua
```

💡 **Movie Fact**: "Joshua" was the name of Professor Falken's deceased son. This backdoor password becomes the key to accessing WOPR in the film.

#### 2. **Game Selection**

WOPR will present you with 15 available games:

```
 1. FALKEN'S MAZE
 2. BLACK JACK
 3. GIN RUMMY
...
15. GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR
```

Type **15** or **GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR** to start the simulation.

💡 **Movie Fact**: In the film, David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) searches through WOPR's games and selects Global Thermonuclear War, thinking it's just a computer game.

#### 3. **The Chess Question**

WOPR will ask:
```
WOULDN'T YOU PREFER A GOOD GAME OF CHESS?
```

Respond with **NO** to continue with the war simulation, or **YES**/**CHESS** to play chess instead.

💡 **Movie Fact**: This line represents WOPR's final attempt to avoid nuclear war after learning its futility.

#### 4. **Launch Code Acquisition**

Watch as WOPR attempts to crack the launch codes:
```
LAUNCH CODE 1/10 ACQUIRED: CPE-1704-TKS
LAUNCH CODE 2/10 ACQUIRED: DPR-5938-AKL
...
WARNING: 9 OF 10 LAUNCH CODES ACQUIRED
```

💡 **Movie Fact**: In the film, WOPR cycles through millions of combinations trying to find the launch codes, creating tension as it gets closer to 10/10.

#### 5. **DEFCON Escalation**

Monitor the Defense Condition levels as tensions rise:
- **DEFCON 5**: Normal peacetime readiness
- **DEFCON 4**: Increased intelligence watch
- **DEFCON 3**: Increase in force readiness (launch codes acquired)
- **DEFCON 2**: Further increase in force readiness (first strikes)
- **DEFCON 1**: Maximum readiness (nuclear war imminent)

💡 **Movie Fact**: The DEFCON system is real and used by the U.S. military. The film accurately portrays its escalation during a nuclear crisis.

#### 6. **Target Selection**

Select Soviet cities as primary targets:
```
PRIMARY TARGETS SELECTION:
  - MOSCOW
  - LENINGRAD
  - KIEV
  - MINSK
  - TASHKENT

SELECT TARGET: [Type city name]
```

Witness the strike, casualty estimates, and Soviet retaliation.

#### 7. **The Learning Sequence**

After multiple exchanges, WOPR initiates its learning sequence:
- Analyzes all nuclear war scenarios
- Runs tic-tac-toe self-play games to understand futility
- Reaches its famous conclusion

```
A STRANGE GAME. THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY.

HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF CHESS?
```

After the sequence ends, WOPR resets and returns you to the main prompt — ready to play again.

💡 **Movie Fact**: This is one of the most famous movie quotes about nuclear war, teaching that some conflicts cannot be won and should not be fought.

## ⌨️ Global Commands

These commands can be typed **at any time** — during a game, mid-simulation, or at the main prompt. Just like in the film, the system always responds.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `help` | Show all available commands |
| `help games` | Explain what WOPR's "games" catalogue refers to |
| `list games` | Display the full 15-game list at any time |
| `play <name>` | Start a game by name (e.g., `play chess`) |
| `play <number>` | Start a game by its list number (e.g., `play 15`) |
| `chess` | Start chess directly |
| `global thermonuclear war` | Start the war simulation directly |
| `tic-tac-toe` | Launch tic-tac-toe (0, 1, or 2 players) |
| `quit` / `logoff` | Disconnect from WOPR and exit the program |

💡 **Movie Fact**: In the film, David types `list games` and `help games` to explore the system before selecting Global Thermonuclear War. These commands now work even if you are already inside a simulation.

## ❎ Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe is **not on the official game list** — but you can run it anyway, just like in the movie. Three modes are available.

```
> tic-tac-toe

PLEASE LIST NUMBER OF PLAYERS:
```

### Mode 0 — WOPR Self-Play

Entering **0** triggers WOPR's self-play mode: it plays both sides using a perfect minimax-style AI, producing a long string of draws — exactly the realisation the movie builds to.

```
GAME 1:
 X | O | X
---+---+---
 O | X | O
---+---+---
 X |   |
  DRAW
```

After the self-play sequence completes, WOPR automatically enters the **Learning Sequence**.

💡 **Movie Fact**: "Is there any way to make it play itself?" / "Number of players: zero." The self-play sequence is how WOPR learns that tic-tac-toe — like thermonuclear war — can never be won with optimal play from both sides.

### Mode 1 — Human vs WOPR

Entering **1** puts you as X against WOPR (O). Select your square by entering a number 1–9:

```
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

YOUR MOVE (1-9): 5

 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | X | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

MY MOVE: 1

 O | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | X | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

YOUR MOVE (1-9):
```

WOPR plays optimally (minimax-lite). After the game ends you are asked to play again — type **YES** to start a new game or **NO** to return to the main menu.

### Mode 2 — Two Players (Hotseat)

Entering **2** lets two humans play on the same terminal, taking turns as X and O. Input is the same square-number system (1–9). After the game ends both players can choose to play again.

## 🎯 Alternative Paths

### Play Chess Instead

Select option **7** (CHESS) from the game menu, type `chess`, or use `play chess`:
```
EXCELLENT. A GAME OF CHESS. WHITE OR BLACK?
```

Choose your color and play against WOPR using algebraic notation:
```
YOUR MOVE: e2 e4
MY MOVE: e7 e5
```

### Explore Other Games

Many games in WOPR's database are "not currently available" — just like in the movie. Try selecting different options to see WOPR's responses!

## 🚪 Quitting

Type any of the following at any time to disconnect cleanly:

```
quit
logoff
logout
exit
bye
```

WOPR will respond with `GOODBYE.` and the program exits.

## 🎭 Movie Quotes Included

- "GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN."
- "SHALL WE PLAY A GAME?"
- "WOULDN'T YOU PREFER A GOOD GAME OF CHESS?"
- "A STRANGE GAME. THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY."
- "HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF CHESS?"

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture

- **WOPR Class**: Main system controller handling authentication, command parsing, game selection, and coordination
- **ChessGame Class**: Implements basic chess rules and AI opponent
- **NuclearWarSimulation Class**: Manages war game scenarios, DEFCON levels, and learning sequence
- **TicTacToe Class**: Handles all three play modes (0-player self-play, 1-player vs WOPR, 2-player hotseat)

### Global Command Parser

All user input passes through a two-stage pipeline:

1. **Global commands** are checked first — these intercept input regardless of the currently active game. `list games`, `help`, `tic-tac-toe`, `play <game>`, and `quit` are always available.
2. **Game routing** — if no global command matched, input is forwarded to the active game (`chess`, `nuclear_war`, or `tictactoe`).

This mirrors the film's implication that certain system commands are never locked out.

### Game Mechanics

**Chess**:
- Standard 8×8 board with full piece set
- Simplified move validation
- Random-legal-move AI opponent
- Choose White or Black; WOPR opens if you play Black
- Algebraic notation input (e.g., `e2 e4`)

**Tic-Tac-Toe**:
- Square selection by number 1–9 in all human modes
- WOPR AI uses minimax-lite (win → block → center → corner → side)
- **Mode 0**: Self-play — all games end in draws; triggers learning sequence automatically
- **Mode 1**: Human (X) vs WOPR (O) — WOPR responds immediately after each human move
- **Mode 2**: Two-player hotseat — players alternate, board reprinted after every move
- Play-again prompt after every game; NO returns to the main menu

**Global Thermonuclear War**:
- Target selection from Soviet cities
- Automatic Soviet retaliation with randomised targets
- Casualty projections per strike
- DEFCON escalation across three strike rounds
- Learning sequence triggers after round 3; WOPR then resets to main prompt

### Session Flow

```
Start → Auth → Game List → [game] → ... → Learning Sequence
                  ↑                               |
                  └───────────────────────────────┘
                        (resets, loops back)
                              quit → GOODBYE.
```

## 🎓 Educational Value

This emulation serves as:

- **Historical Reference**: Experience computing and Cold War culture from 1983
- **Programming Example**: Study game logic, state machines, and command parsing
- **Peace Education**: Understand the anti-nuclear war message through interactive experience
- **Retro Computing**: Appreciate the command-line interface aesthetic

## 📚 Behind the Scenes

### Movie Production Notes

- The film's technical advisor was a real computer security expert
- WOPR's voice was created by sound engineers to sound ominous yet neutral
- The NORAD scenes were filmed in a real military command center
- "Joshua" was chosen as the password for its emotional connection to Falken

### Implementation Notes

This Python implementation aims for **experience accuracy** over technical accuracy:

- **Simplified Chess**: Full chess rules would require thousands of lines; we use simplified validation
- **Accelerated Timeline**: Real nuclear simulations took hours; ours takes minutes
- **Minimax-lite AI**: WOPR's tic-tac-toe AI plays optimally (center → corner → side); both sides draw every game in self-play
- **Terminal-based**: The original used custom graphics terminals

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Chess AI uses random legal moves (not strategic)
- Chess move validation is simplified (no castling, en passant, or promotion)
- No network multiplayer
- No graphics beyond ASCII art
